# The Stack

Hey, so everyone has their favourites right? Here's a few of mine.


## Language

> **typescript**

Such a well polished and wonderful typing system. I know this is a stepping stone to a better language, but JavaScript is really comfortable at this point. TypeScript dials the safety part in.


## Language Support

> **tslint**

A linter with a great set of rules is awesome.

> **husky**, **lint-staged**, **prettier**

Some automation so I stop checking in crap-looking code.


## Rendering

> **react**, **react-dom**

Can't imagine doing web differently to be honest. I'm sure we will soon, but for mid-2017, this is dominating.

> **vanilla react**

There are lot of great libraries out there for UI. This intentionally uses none of them. Don't hestitate to bring one in and use it if that's how you roll.

I'm keep it straight-up react here because some types of apps I'd will be using webgl, pixi, or are pure svg interfaces.


## State Management

> **mobx**, **mobx-react**

It brings the same things to the table as `redux`, but with considerably less typing.

> **mobx-state-tree**

A nice little addition from the `mobx` team. It brings `redux`-like state trees, immutability, and type guarantees. Love it.


## Keyboard Support

> **mousetrap**

The main menu in electron has keyboard accelators, but we still need one in the renderer for convenience.

Mousetrap fills that gap. It's a pretty decent little library despite not being maintained any more (lol@js). Does the job though. I've tried a couple of others but keep coming back to this one.


## Utilities

> **ramda** 

There's so much awesome packed in here. `pipe` for days. I'll be honest, it took me a long time get comfortable with `ramda`. Nowadays, you can pry it from my cold dead hands. PRECIOUS!!!


## Electron Things

> **electron-builder**

This does most of the heavy lifting for assembling cross-platform distributables.

> **electron-updater**

Allows our app to auto-update.

> **electron-is-dev**, **electron-log**

A few quality-of-life utilities for working in Electron.

> **electron-store**

Persist JSON to the file system.


## Bundler

> **fuse-box**

Yes, you read that right. Not WebPack. WebPack always rubbed me wrong. Maybe it's the config? Maybe it's the way they name things? I'm not sure.

What I do know is, once I started playing with FuseBox, I was sold. I like the devs behind this too.


## Testing

> **ava**

This is my favourite testing framework. I've tried them all. The devs behind this are very talented, helpful, and friendly.


## Compile Time Utilities

> **npm-scripts-info**, **npm-run-all**

Quality-of-life utilities for npm.


## Docs

> **docsify**

You're reading it right now.

* No build-time required.
* Themeable.
* Drops in your `master` branch.
* Supports plugins.
* Hooks up to github without deployment scripts.

Love it.
