# The Stack

Hey, so everyone has their favourites right? Here's a few of mine.

## Language

> **typescript**

Such a well polished and wonderful typing system. I know this is a stepping stone to a better language, but JavaScript is really comfortable at this point. TypeScript dials the safety part in.


## Language Support

> **tslint**

A linter with a great set of rules is awesome.

> **husky**, **lint-staged**, **prettier**

Some automation so I stop checking in crap-looking code.


## Rendering

> **react**, **react-dom**

Can't imagine doing web differently to be honest. I'm sure we will soon, but for mid-2017, this is dominating.

> **rebass**

I'm not sure if I'll keep this one, but it's looking good for now.  It brings a great way to stitch together UIs.

It brings, however, a butt-tonne of dependencies (29) including, most notably, `styled-components` although that is behind the scenes.


## State Management

> **mobx**, **mobx-react**

It brings the same things to the table as `redux`, but with considerably less typing.

> **mobx-state-tree**

A nice little addition from the `mobx` team. It brings `redux`-like state trees, immutability, and type guarantees. Love it.


## Utilities

> **ramda** 

There's so much awesome packed in here. `pipe` for days. I'll be honest, it took me a long time get comfortable with `ramda`. Nowadays, you can pry it from my cold dead hands. PRECIOUS!!!


## Electron Things

> **electron-builder**

This does most of the heavy lifting for assembling cross-platform distributables.

> **electron-updater**

Allows our app to auto-update.

> **electron-is-dev**, **electron-log**

A few quality-of-life utilities for working in Electron.

## Bundler

> **fuse-box**

Yes, you read that right. Not WebPack. WebPack always rubbed me wrong. Maybe it's the config? Maybe it's the way they name things? I'm not sure.

What I do know is, once I started playing with FuseBox, I was sold. I like the devs behind this too.


## Testing

> **ava**

This is my favourite testing framework. I've tried them all. The devs behind this are very talented, helpful, and friendly.


## Compile Time Utilities

> **npm-scripts-info**, **npm-run-all**

Quality-of-life utilities for npm.


## Docs

> **docsify**

You're reading it right now.

* No build-time required.
* Themeable.
* Drops in your `master` branch.
* Supports plugins.
* Hooks up to github without deployment scripts.

Love it.
