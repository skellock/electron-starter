## Test Drive

Want to try this out? Clone & run.  There's a small sample project included.

cd electron-starter
npm i
npm start
```

_Requires `node@>=8.1` and `npm@>=5.2`._

## Start Your Own Project

Ready to start your project?

I'm still deciding on a simple way, but there will be a script you can run.

```sh
npm run time-to-shine
```

## Building

To build your apps, first bundle it:

```sh
npm run compile
```

Then you can `pack` a copy to see what it will look like assembled:

```sh
npm run pack
```

And when you're ready to ship:

```sh
npm run dist
```

To create a .zip and .dmg in the `dist` directory.
